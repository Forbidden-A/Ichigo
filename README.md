# Ichigo

Ichigo is a discord bot written in python.

## Running the bot

When I add docker and things I'll update the instructions.
Currently in order to run the bot you need at least a file called `config.yml`

```yml
bot: 

```

in it, I'll update this with all possible values later
you can provide the token under bot.token in the config file or, the **recommended** way is to create a `.env` file with `ICHIGO_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE` in it.
